      <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
          Though it is unknown where Fio was born, she discovered her Humans at the NOAH Center in Stanwood, Washington in 2004. At that time she was a mere kitten,<br>
          stuck in a room with so many other kittens. Though she doesn't consider herself lucky to have been chosen as a companion, she has been quoted as saying,<br>
          "Meow meow mew rawr," which is enough for this author to understand the sentiment.<br>
          <br>
          Fio was not alone in being brought home that fateful day, as her adoptive brother JiJi also tagged along. Though not partcularly useful, JiJi did make the <br>
          initial contact with the Human (hereafter referred to as "Human 2"). Once JiJi had been chosen, shelter staff recommended that a second cat be chosen as <br>
          well, stating, "That cat is needy and we recommend bringing him home with a friend." Though on arrival at home Human 1 would accuse Human 2 of being upsold, <br>
          she quickly realized that indeed JiJi was the neediest of cats, and besides the obvious reasons (such as her beauty, grace, and superior intelligence), <br>
          it was a good thing that Fio was brought home, if nothing else but to provide JiJi with a distraction.
