        <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>

          <h3 class="important">Early Life</h3>
          <p>
          Though it is unknown where Fio was born, she discovered her Humans at the NOAH Center in Stanwood, Washington in 2004. At that time she was a mere kitten,
          stuck in a room with so many other kittens. Though she doesn't consider herself lucky to have been chosen as a companion, she has been quoted as saying,
          "Meow meow mew rawr," which is enough for this author to understand the sentiment.</p>

          <p>
          Fio was not alone in being brought home that fateful day, as her adoptive brother JiJi also tagged along. Though not partcularly useful,
          JiJi did make the initial contact with the Human (hereafter referred to as "Human 2"). Once JiJi had been chosen, shelter staff recommended
          that a second cat be chosen as well, stating, "That cat is needy and we recommend bringing him home with a friend." Though on arrival at
          home Human 1 would accuse Human 2 of being upsold, she quickly realized that indeed JiJi was the neediest of cats, and besides the obvious
          reasons (such as her beauty, grace, and superior intelligence), it was a good thing that Fio was brought home, if nothing else but to provide JiJi with a distraction.

        <h2>Hitting Her Prime</h2>

          <p>
          Throughout her life, Fio has aspired to be the best at all she does. Whether it's hunting for dirty socks, yelling at "ghosts" in the bathroom, or refusing to chew her food, she excels in all her endeavors. Some could say that she's a little too good at some of these things, leading to socks strewn about,
          confused Humans, and extensive tooth decay. Though she is a cat of many skills, without a doubt the thing that Fio is the best at is having nicknames.</p>
          <p>
          Known alternatively as FiFi, Kitten Cow Cat, Captain Cat, Co-Captain Cat, Girl Cat, Girly-Girl, Huffington Loaf, Beefy FiFi, and many others, she has endeared
          herself to all she has met with her wide variety of nicknames.</p>
