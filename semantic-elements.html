  <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
  <h2>DC Heroes</h2>
  <p><em>DC superhero comics are the best.</em><br>The storylines are more complex and <u>often address real life social issues.</u> My favorite is <strong>Green Arrow.</strong></p>

  <h3><small>Marvel Heroes</small></h3>
  <p><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more two dimensional</q>; however, Marvel is really killing it in the film and tv industries, where DC's attempts to capitalize on their success are more mediocre.</p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <blockquote>To summarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes, but they do have decent movies and tv shows (whatever that's worth).</blockquote> <p>It's worth noting here that I'm actually a Marvel fan anyway.</p>
