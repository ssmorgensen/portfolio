            <h3>A Quick Word About Cats</h3>
            There is some controversy about the concept of cats versus dogs; often you'll find humans identifying themselves as "Cat People" or "Dog People". <br>
            Seldom do you see a human that doesn't have a tendency to prefer one type of animal over the other, and this has been accepted by the affected animals. <br>
            While the cats and dogs of the world find this concept flattering and amusing, dogs often take the attitude of, "Why can't we all just get along?" Cats <br>
            on the other hand understand their position in this world and take more of a "you're with us, or you're against us" attitude.

      <p>Fio has included a link to a very special project above which she feels best describes the most reasonable attitude toward cats. She'll let you guess which one.</p>
