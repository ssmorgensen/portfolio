            <p class="articles-p">
            There is some controversy about the concept of cats versus dogs; often you'll find humans identifying themselves as "Cat People" or "Dog People". Seldom do you see a human that doesn't have a tendency to prefer one type of animal over the other, and this has been accepted by the affected animals.
            While the cats and dogs of the world find this concept flattering and amusing, dogs often take the attitude of, "Why can't we all just get along?" Cats on the other hand understand their position in this world and take more of a "you're with us, or you're against us" attitude.

      <p class="project">Fio has included a link to a very special project above which she feels best describes the most reasonable attitude toward cats.<br>
        She'll let you guess which one.</p>
